# Music Quiz App

Fun little quiz tool for you and your friends. Uses the free preview audio files that Spotify provides.
This tool interfaces with the Spotify Web API and you must create a client ID/client secret to use their API for requests (updating use-accessToken.js in the files).
Simple setup to do this is available on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

Dependencies: 
- MUI (Component library) - https://mui.com/
- Axios (HTTP client for handling requests)

Includes:
- Song randomization
- Search tool (will only display songs that Spotify makes available)
- Importing playlists (does not currently work for album/song links)

This was built as a first-time project for learning the basics of React.js. Enjoy!
